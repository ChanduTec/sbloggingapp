1)Create a class with all types of methods and constructors and execute it.
2) Create a class AshokIt. Inside the class “AshokIt”, create a 
static method displayStaticMessage() and write some message in it. Create a main 
method and call the displayStaticMessage() method from the main using: 
a. Class name 
b. Using object. 
c. Null reference 
3)Create a class “Toy”.Create a static method to display the toy name i.e getToyName() 
and a non-static method like getToyCost(). 
a. Call both methods from the main method directly without an object and without 
a class name.
b. Call both methods with class names. Can you call both methods with class names? 
c. Create an object and call both the method with object. Can you call both of them 
with an object reference?
4)Create a class “AshokIt” and 
a. Create one static variable x and one static variable y. 
b. In the main method print both the values without class name and object reference, 
What o/p you will get or you will get an error?
5)Create a Parent Class AshokIt with instance and static methods, Create a child class with the name "JavaDeveloper" and override the instance methods in the child class
6)Create a class AshokIt, and create a method with name coding(); Overload the method with different input parameters.
7)Examples of  Overloading With the help of the static methods.
8)Execute the overridden methods in the child class main method, By creating the Parent class reference variables to the child class.
9)Execute the overridden methods in the child class main method, By creating the Child class Object reference.
10)Create a program when ClassCastException will come.
11)Write a program to override the parent class method into the child class by changing their return types.
12)Write a program to overload the methods by changing their return types.
13)How to execute one class of private methods into another class.
14)Write a code on how to overload the main method.
